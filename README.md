## Customer Churn Prediction Project

### 1)Problem Statement

**The Business Context:** In the highly competitive telecommunications sector, customer retention is the single most critical driver of profitability. Industry statistics indicate that acquiring a new customer costs 5 to 25 times more than retaining an existing one. Furthermore, a mere 5% increase in customer retention can boost overall profits by 25% to 95%.

**The Pain Point:** "Telco X" is currently experiencing a high churn rate, where valuable customers are terminating their subscriptions in favor of competitors. This "silent leak" in revenue is not only increasing Customer Acquisition Costs (CAC) but also eroding Customer Lifetime Value (CLV).

**The Solution:** Traditional retention strategies (e.g., mass marketing emails) are inefficient because they target the wrong people. This project implements a precision-based Machine Learning solution to Predict exactly which customers are at high risk of churning in the next month. Identify the specific root causes for each customer (e.g., "Fiber Optic user with no Tech Support").Enable the support team to take proactive, targeted action (e.g., offering a specific discount) before the customer leaves.
